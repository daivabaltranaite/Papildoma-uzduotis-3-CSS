              HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to develop web
              pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
              specification which was
              published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML
              4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01,
              and this version
              was published in 2012.
